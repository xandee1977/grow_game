Sky Eraser demo 0.4.2
By Prerisoft - http://prerisoft.cleverpun.com/

---

Well, here it is! From January to the very arse-end of December 2013, I have
worked on this project, and I feel comfortable enough with its progress to
release a demonstration of it, even with access to its horribly-written,
unstandard and unoptimised source code for folks over on the UNIX end of
things! Please forgive my many faults with this, and where you're interested in
pointing out issues with the code, I would appreciate feedback.

Yes, this is what I call "comfortable enough". I have low standards for myself.

This is, again, a demo of the planned full game - it is largely feature
complete, but it's limited in only having three enemy types, no bomb pickups,
and no replay functionality. However, minor adjustments to existing gameplay
material may still be made based on feedback, so this game is certainly not
final!

For users installing from source, the game depends on the following to run:

* Python 2.7 ( http://python.org/ )
* PyGame ( http://pygame.org/ )
* PyYAML ( http://pyyaml.org/ )
* Appdirs ( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/appdirs/ )

CONTROLS (default):

Direction keys or Joystick X+Y/Hat Switch: Move
Z or Joystick Button 1: Fire, OK
X or Joystick Button 2: Bomb, cancel
Tap fire, C or Joystick Button 3: Autofire
ESC or Joystick Button 4: Pause

Controls can be changed in the Input Assignments Menu, in Settings.

CONFIGURATION:

Along with the settings menu and input assignments, there are also a small
handful of configurable settings accessible only via the config file in the
game's application data, which is stored dependent on your OS (subject to
change).

* For Windows 2000/XP, it's "<user>/Application Data/Prerisoft/sky_eraser".
* For Windows Vista, 7 and 8 it's "<user>/AppData/Local/Prerisoft/sky_eraser".
* For most UNIX or UNIX-derived systems, it's "~/.config/sky_eraser".
* For Mac OS X, it's "/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/sky_eraser".

This may change in the future - the library I'm using to call the directories
in question doesn't really seem to work all that well for me.

The config file-exclusive settings are as follows.

For video:
* show_fps: Displays the FPS in the corner of the screen, updating every
  second with the average over that period of time.

For audio:
* audio_buffer: Size of the buffer. A larger buffer allows less of a chance of
  interference, but comes at the cost of latency and sounds mixing together.
* audio_frequency: Range of the audio spectrum in hertz. I do not know just
  what tolerances this has, but anything past 44100hz seems rather pointless.

For controls:
* joy_deadzone: The point that a joystick or gamepad's analogue X/Y axes have
  to cross in order to register their state change.

For gameplay:
WARNING: if these are not on default values, high scores cannot be recorded!
* starting_lives: How many extra lives you start with, from 0 to 5. Default 2.
* starting_power: How much power your ship spawns with, from 0 to 2. This
  includes when you respawn after dying. Default 0.
* starting_bombs: How many bombs your ship spawns with, from 0 to 5. This
  includes when you respawn after dying. Default 3.
* wave_seed: Extra-hidden value. Takes any signed integer - this will be used
  for the pseudo-RNG's seed when initialising the game. Remove to use default.

CHANGELOG:

0.4.2 (released 2013-12-31)
* First public demo release.

KNOWN ISSUES:

None at this time.
